\subsection{Prologue \& Introduction}\label{prologue-introduction}

This chapter is a continuation of chapter 7. This chapter is focused on
what we are actually doing when we perform a $z$ test. Sometimes
understanding the underlying process, you gain more insight into the
task at hand. Case in point, taking care of a pool. You don't need to
understand the chemistry behind the chlorine and chemical test kits. If
you know it though, you have a better understanding of achieving a pool
that has appropriate levels of chlorine. Let's dive into statistics a
little bit further.

\subsection{Key Concepts}\label{key-concepts}

\item
  Standard Score

  \begin{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
\item

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    The frequency distribution that would be obtained from calculating
    the means of all theoretically possible samples of a designated size
    that could be drawn from a given population.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Concepts, continued}\label{key-concepts-continued}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Central Limit Theorem

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    If repeated random samples of size n are drawn from a population
    that is normally distributed along some variable x, having a mean,
    $\mu$ and a standard deviation $\sigma$, the the sampling
    distribution of all theoretically possible sample means will be a
    normal distribution of all theoretically possible sample means will
    be a normal distribution having a mean $\mu$ and a standard
    deviation of $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Standard Error a.k.a. ``Standard Error of the Mean''

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    The standard deviation of the sampling distribution, designated with
    the symbol $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Normality Assumption

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    The assumption that the population being studied is normally
    distributed along variable x.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Law of Large Numbers

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    A law that states that if the size of the sample, $n$, is
    sufficiently large (no less than 30, preferably no less than 50),
    then the Central Limit Theorem will apply even if the population is
    not normally distributed along, variable x.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note: this requires further testing in the real world\ldots{}for
this class, we will use that assumption without testing. However, we may
find ourselves in the real world testing the normality of a distribution
along a variable x.}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Chapter 7 introduced the test of significance under the lens of the
  $z$ score to demonstrate the procedure. Recall, that
  $z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$.
\item
  Characteristics of $z$

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Frequency distribution: normal distribution
  \item
    Applied to a specific normal curve: sampling distribution of the
    sample means.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What are we doing with $z$

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Taking the given sample statistic and population parameters
  \item
    Locating them on the sampling distribution of the sample means
  \end{itemize}
\item
  All significance tests follow the same method. They just use different
  sampling distributions.
\item
  The test you use must be appropriate for the distribution!
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Normal Distributions}\label{normal-distributions}

\subsubsection{What is normal?}\label{what-is-normal}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Normal is a family of frequency distributions that, when graphed often
  resemble bells.
\item
  Normal = Gaussian
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Family of gaussian distrubutions, by increasing st.
deviation 1 to
4}\label{family-of-gaussian-distrubutions-by-increasing-st.-deviation-1-to-4}

\includegraphics{normal.png}

\subsection{Normal Distributions,
continued}\label{normal-distributions-continued}

\subsubsection{Major characteristics}\label{major-characteristics}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  uni modal
\item
  symmetric
\item
  asymptotic to the x-axis
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reason for the term
``normal''}\label{reason-for-the-term-normal}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  certain characteristics follow a normal distribution

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    height
  \item
    weight
  \item
    intelligence
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Not everything in nature is normally distributed.
\item
  Other distributions are not ``abnormal''\ldots{}they are just
  ``different distributions''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Normal Distributions: Standard
Scores}\label{normal-distributions-standard-scores}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Standard Score

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    score that is universally designated by the letter $z$, in which
    that score is expressed in standard deviation units from the mean.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This time our equation is this: $\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$ and the table for
proportions of area under the standard normal curve is

\includegraphics{ztable.png}

\subsubsection{How do we read this
table?}\label{how-do-we-read-this-table}

\subsection{Reading the table for proportions of area under the standard
normal
curve}\label{reading-the-table-for-proportions-of-area-under-the-standard-normal-curve}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  On the previous slide, we saw a portion of the table for proportions
  of area under the standard normal curve.
\item
  Steps to read the table

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Three columns of A: these are the values of $z$ calculated from the
    equation
  \item
    Three columns of B: these are the area under the curve from the mean
    \emph{out to the specified value of z}
  \item
    Three columns of C: these are the area in the tail \emph{from} the z
    score (the tails)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Tip: the area from column B and column C add to .50 or 50\%

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Example: z = 0.17 with Column B = 0.0675 and Column C = 0.4325 so,
  \item
    $0.0675 + 0.4325 = 0.5000$ or 50\%
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Tip: as z get larger

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Column B gets larger
  \item
    Column C gets SMALLER
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Z Score example with the table pages 227 to
230}\label{z-score-example-with-the-table-pages-227-to-230}

\subsubsection{Sandy's IQ}\label{sandys-iq}

Question: What proportion of people are above and below Sandy's IQ.

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Sandy score = 115 (observed)
\item
  Mean = 100 (expected)
\item
  Standard Deviation is 10
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{sandy1.png}

\subsubsection{So how do we handle
this?}\label{so-how-do-we-handle-this}

\subsection{Sandy's z Score}\label{sandys-z-score}

The z equation is: $\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Sandy's z score is: $\frac{115 - 100}{10}=\frac{15}{10}=1.5$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{From the z table in the
book:}\label{from-the-z-table-in-the-book}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Percentage of people below Sandy

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    IQs between 100 and 114 for $z=1.5$ (column B) = .4332
  \item
    IQs between 0 and 100: = .5000 (50 percent of the people are below
    the population mean or expected mean)
  \item
    Add these two together: $.4332 + .500 = .9332$, which is the
    proportion of people with IQs below Sandy! Pretty Smart, eh? Sandy
    is above the mean (that is why the z score is positive).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The proportion of people with IQs below Sandy is
.9332}\label{the-proportion-of-people-with-iqs-below-sandy-is-.9332}

\subsection{What about when z is negative? Pg.
229}\label{what-about-when-z-is-negative-pg.-229}

What if George has a score of 80 on the IQ? This is not a problem
because we know z scores can be positive (above the mean) and negative
(below the mean).

\includegraphics{george1.png}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  George's z score is: $\frac{80 - 100}{10}=\frac{-20}{10}=-2.0$
\item
  At first, you might be confused\ldots{}but remember that the normal
  curve is symmetrical.

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Meaning what happens on one side of the mean will happen on the
    other side of the mean\ldots{}you can use z = 2.00 on page 232 of
    the textbook.
  \item
    Column B is .4772
  \item
    \textbf{Column C is .0228} the proportion of people with IQs below
    George
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We are still not finished with the proportion of people \textbf{Above}
  George.

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Recall that .5000 are above the mean (properties of the st. normal
    curve)\ldots{}and we need the proportion from George's score to the
    mean.
  \item
    Therefore $.4772 + 0.500 = 0.9772$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Nearly 98\% of all IQ scores fall above George's
score.}\label{nearly-98-of-all-iq-scores-fall-above-georges-score.}

\subsection{The FAMOUS \& FABULOUS Central Limit Theorem
(CLT)}\label{the-famous-fabulous-central-limit-theorem-clt}

\textbf{CLT}: If repeated random samples of size n are drawn from a
population that is normally distributed along some variable x, having a
mean, $\mu$ and a standard deviation $\sigma$, the the sampling
distribution of all theoretically possible sample means will be a normal
distribution of all theoretically possible sample means will be a normal
distribution having a mean $\mu$ and a standard deviation of
$\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For a particular population, a variable (x) is normally distributed
  \ldots{} if we draw a series of samples of predetermined approximately
  large sample size (n) from that population, the CLT tells us the
  following:
\item
  Sampling distribution of sample means will be a NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
\item
  The mean of the sampling distribution of sample means:

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    the mean of all sample means (designated $\bar{x}$) will be EQUAL TO
    $\mu$
  \item
    $\mu$ is the mean from the population that the sample is drawn from.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The St.~Dev. of the sampling distribution of sample means

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    will be EQUAL to $\frac{\sigma}{n}$

Scenario: A competency exam score is given to students with a sample
size of 100 ninth grade students enrolled in a six week course to
prepare for the exam. The sample mean is 73, the population mean is 70,
and the population standard deviation is 20. Set alpha to .05 and use a
one-tailed directional hypothesis.

$\frac{3}{2}$ = 1.50

Critical value of z when $\alpha=0.05$ is 1.65 and we reject if our z is
greater. Drum roll\ldots{}.the result is: $1.50 < 1.65$ and we
\textbf{fail} to reject $H_0$ in favor of the $H_1$

\subsection{Normality Assumption}\label{normality-assumption}

The assumption that the population being studied is normally distributed
along variable x.

\subsection{Law of Large Numbers}\label{law-of-large-numbers}

A law that states that if the size of the sample, $n$, is sufficiently
large (no less than 30, preferably no less than 50), then the Central
Limit Theorem will apply even if the population is not normally
distributed along, variable x.

This is a new version of the standard deviation equation, but recall the
equation for standard deviation which is the square root of variance. It
is really this equation: $\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma (x-\bar{x})^2}{n}}$.

\subsubsection{The t- test}\label{the-t--test}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt

    $\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma (x - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$

\subsection{Degrees of Freedom (a.k.a.
``DF'')}\label{degrees-of-freedom-a.k.a.-df}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  In the figure on the previous slide, we introduced a new
  concept\ldots{}DF
\item
  Textbook definition of Degrees of Freedom:

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    A number that is generated to make use of a table of critical values
  \end{itemize}
\item
  It is the number of independent ways by which a dynamic system can
  move without violating any constraint imposed on it, is called degree
  of freedom. In other words, the degree of freedom can be defined as
  the minimum number of independent coordinates that can specify the
  position of the system completely.
\item
  Estimates of statistical parameters can be based upon different
  amounts of information or data. The number of independent pieces of
  information that go into the estimate of a parameter is called the
  degrees of freedom. In general, the degrees of freedom of an estimate
  of a parameter is equal to the number of independent scores that go
  into the estimate minus the number of parameters used as intermediate
  steps in the estimation of the parameter itself (i.e., the sample
  variance has N-1 degrees of freedom, since it is computed from N
  random scores minus the only 1 parameter estimated as intermediate
  step, which is the sample mean).
\item
  Mathematically, degrees of freedom is the number of dimensions of the
  domain of a random vector, or essentially the number of `free'
  components (how many components need to be known before the vector is
  fully determined).
\item
  The term is most often used in the context of linear models (linear
  regression, analysis of variance), where certain random vectors are
  constrained to lie in linear sub spaces, and the number of degrees of
  freedom is the dimension of the subspace. The degrees of freedom are
  also commonly associated with the squared lengths (or ``sum of
  squares'' of the coordinates) of such vectors, and the parameters of
  chi-squared and other distributions that arise in associated
  statistical testing problems.
\item
  While introductory textbooks may introduce degrees of freedom as
  distribution parameters or through hypothesis testing, it is the
  underlying geometry that defines degrees of freedom, and is critical
  to a proper understanding of the concept. Walker (1940) has stated
  this succinctly as ``the number of observations minus the number of
  necessary relations among these observations.''

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Given N = 5 marbles, K = 3 colors (red, blue, green)
\item
  Solve the permutation

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    $P_K^N = \frac{N!}{(N-K)!}$ = $P_K^N = \frac{5!}{(5-3)!}$ =
    $P_K^N = \frac{5!}{2!}$ = $P_K^N = \frac{5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1}{2 x 1}$
    = $\frac{120}{2}$ = $60$

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Combination}\label{combination}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Given N = 5 marbles, K = 3 colors (red, blue, green) but the
  \emph{order} matters this time
\item
  Solve the combination

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    $C_K^N = \frac{N!}{K!(N-K)!}$ = $\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!}$ =
    $\frac{5!}{3!2!}$ = $\frac{5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1}{(3 x 2 x 1)(2 x 1)}$ =
    $\frac{120}{(6)(2)}$ = $\frac{120}{12}$ = $10$
