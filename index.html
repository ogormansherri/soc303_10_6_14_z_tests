  <h2>Prologue &amp; Introduction</h2>
  <p>This chapter is a continuation of chapter 7. This chapter is focused on what we are actually doing when we perform a \(z\) test. Sometimes understanding the underlying process, you gain more insight into the task at hand. Case in point, taking care of a pool. You don&#39;t need to understand the chemistry behind the chlorine and chemical test kits. If you know it though, you have a better understanding of achieving a pool that has appropriate levels of chlorine. Let&#39;s dive into statistics a little bit further.</p>

  <h2>Key Concepts, continued</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Central Limit Theorem

<ul>
<li>If repeated random samples of size n are drawn from a population that is normally distributed along some variable x, having a mean, \(\mu\) and a standard deviation \(\sigma\), the the sampling distribution of all theoretically possible sample means will be a normal distribution of all theoretically possible sample means will be a normal distribution having a mean \(\mu\) and a standard deviation of \(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\).</li>

<li>The assumption that the population being studied is normally distributed along variable x.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Law of Large Numbers

<li>A law that states that if the size of the sample, \(n\), is sufficiently large (no less than 30, preferably no less than 50), then the Central Limit Theorem will apply even if the population is not normally distributed along, variable x. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note: this requires further testing in the real world...for this class, we will use that assumption without testing. However, we may find ourselves in the real world testing the normality of a distribution along a variable x.</strong></p>

  <h2>Normal Distributions</h2>
  <h3>What is normal?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Normal is a family of frequency distributions that, when graphed often resemble bells.</li>
<li>Normal = Gaussian</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family of gaussian distrubutions, by increasing st. deviation 1 to 4</h3>

<p><img src="normal.png" alt="width"></p>

</section>
<section class="slide class" id="NormalDistr">
  <h2>Normal Distributions, continued</h2>
  <h3>Major characteristics</h3>

<ul>
<li>uni modal</li>
<li>symmetric</li>
<li>asymptotic to the x-axis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reason for the term &quot;normal&quot;</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>certain characteristics follow a normal distribution</p>

<ul>
<li>height</li>
<li>weight</li>
<li>intelligence</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Not everything in nature is normally distributed.</p></li>
<li><p>Other distributions are not &quot;abnormal&quot;...they are just &quot;different distributions&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class="slide class" id="NormalDistr2">
  <h2>Normal Distributions: Standard Scores</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Standard Score

<ul>
<li>score that is universally designated by the letter \(z\), in which that score is expressed in standard deviation units from the mean.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This time our equation is this: \(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\) and the table for proportions of area under the standard normal curve is </p>

<p><img src="ztable.png" alt="width"></p>

<h3>How do we read this table?</h3>

</section>
<section class="slide class" id="NormalDistr3">
  <h2>Reading the table for proportions of area under the standard normal curve</h2>
  <ul>
<li>On the previous slide, we saw a portion of the table for proportions of area under the standard normal curve. </li>
<li>Steps to read the table

<ul>
<li>Three columns of A: these are the values of \(z\) calculated from the equation</li>
<li>Three columns of B: these are the area under the curve from the mean <em>out to the specified value of z</em></li>
<li>Three columns of C: these are the area in the tail <em>from</em> the z score (the tails)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tip: the area from column B and column C add to .50 or 50%

<ul>
<li>Example: z = 0.17 with Column B = 0.0675 and Column C = 0.4325 so, </li>
<li>\(0.0675 + 0.4325 = 0.5000\) or 50%</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tip: as z get larger

<ul>
<li>Column B gets larger</li>
<li>Column C gets SMALLER</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

  <h2>Z Score example with the table pages 227 to 230</h2>
  <h3>Sandy&#39;s IQ</h3>

<p>Question: What proportion of people are above and below Sandy&#39;s IQ.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sandy score = 115 (observed)</li>
<li>Mean = 100 (expected)</li>
<li>Standard Deviation is 10</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="sandy1.png" alt="width"></p>

<h3>So how do we handle this?</h3>

</section>
<section class="slide class" id="NormalDistr5">
  <h2>Sandy&#39;s z Score</h2>
  <p>The z equation is: \(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\)</p>

<ul>
<li>Sandy&#39;s z score is: \(\frac{115 - 100}{10}=\frac{15}{10}=1.5\)</li>
</ul>

<h3>From the z table in the book:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Percentage of people below Sandy

<ul>
<li>IQs between 100 and 114 for \(z=1.5\) (column B) = .4332</li>
<li>IQs between 0 and 100: = .5000 (50 percent of the people are below the population mean or expected mean)</li>
<li>Add these two together: \(.4332 + .500 = .9332\), which is the proportion of people with IQs below Sandy! Pretty Smart, eh? Sandy is above the mean (that is why the z score is positive).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>The proportion of people with IQs below Sandy is .9332</h3>

<section class="slide class" id="NormalDistr6">
  <h2>What about when z is negative? Pg. 229</h2>
  <p>What if George has a score of 80 on the IQ? This is not a problem because we know z scores can be positive (above the mean) and negative (below the mean).</p>

<p><img src="george1.png" alt="width"></p>

<ul>
<li>George&#39;s z score is: \(\frac{80 - 100}{10}=\frac{-20}{10}=-2.0\)</li>
<li>At first, you might be confused...but remember that the normal curve is symmetrical. 

<ul>
<li>Meaning what happens on one side of the mean will happen on the other side of the mean...you can use z = 2.00 on page 232 of the textbook.</li>
<li>Column B is .4772</li>
<li><strong>Column C is .0228</strong> the proportion of people with IQs below George</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We are still not finished with the proportion of people <strong>Above</strong> George.

<ul>
<li>Recall that .5000 are above the mean (properties of the st. normal curve)...and we need the proportion from George&#39;s score to the mean.</li>
<li>Therefore \(.4772 + 0.500 = 0.9772\)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Nearly 98% of all IQ scores fall above George&#39;s score.</h3>

  <h2>The FAMOUS &amp; FABULOUS Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</h2>
  <p><strong>CLT</strong>:  If repeated random samples of size n are drawn from a population that is normally distributed along some variable x, having a mean, \(\mu\) and a standard deviation \(\sigma\), the the sampling distribution of all theoretically possible sample means will be a normal distribution of all theoretically possible sample means will be a normal distribution having a mean \(\mu\) and a standard deviation of \(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\).</p>

  <h2>CLT at work....an example through a story</h2>
  <p>Scenario: A competency exam score is given to students with a sample size of 100 ninth grade students enrolled in a six week course to prepare for the exam. The sample mean is  73, the population mean is 70, and the population standard deviation is 20. Set alpha to .05 and use a one-tailed directional hypothesis.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Null -- \(H_0: \mu_{all} = \mu_{course}\) </li>
<li>Directional Alt -- \(H_1: \mu_{all} ≠ \mu_{course}\)</li>

<h3>Equation for z using chapter 7</h3>

<h3>Significant or not...</h3>

<p>Critical value of z when \(\alpha=0.05\) is 1.65 and we reject if our z is greater. Drum roll....the result is: \(1.50 < 1.65\) and we <strong>fail</strong> to reject \(H_0\) in favor of the \(H_1\)</p>

  <h2>Degrees of Freedom (a.k.a. &quot;DF&quot;)</h2>
  <ul>
<li>In the figure on the previous slide, we introduced a new concept...DF</li>
<li>Textbook definition of Degrees of Freedom:

<ul>
<li>A number that is generated to make use of a table of critical values</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is the number of independent ways by which a dynamic system can move without violating any constraint imposed on it, is called degree of freedom. In other words, the degree of freedom can be defined as the minimum number of independent coordinates that can specify the position of the system completely.</li>
<li>Estimates of statistical parameters can be based upon different amounts of information or data. The number of independent pieces of information that go into the estimate of a parameter is called the degrees of freedom. In general, the degrees of freedom of an estimate of a parameter is equal to the number of independent scores that go into the estimate minus the number of parameters used as intermediate steps in the estimation of the parameter itself (i.e., the sample variance has N-1 degrees of freedom, since it is computed from N random scores minus the only 1 parameter estimated as intermediate step, which is the sample mean).</li>
<li>Mathematically, degrees of freedom is the number of dimensions of the domain of a random vector, or essentially the number of &#39;free&#39; components (how many components need to be known before the vector is fully determined).</li>
<li>The term is most often used in the context of linear models (linear regression, analysis of variance), where certain random vectors are constrained to lie in linear sub spaces, and the number of degrees of freedom is the dimension of the subspace. The degrees of freedom are also commonly associated with the squared lengths (or &quot;sum of squares&quot; of the coordinates) of such vectors, and the parameters of chi-squared and other distributions that arise in associated statistical testing problems.</li>
<li>While introductory textbooks may introduce degrees of freedom as distribution parameters or through hypothesis testing, it is the underlying geometry that defines degrees of freedom, and is critical to a proper understanding of the concept. Walker (1940) has stated this succinctly as &quot;the number of observations minus the number of necessary relations among these observations.&quot;<br></li>

  <h2>Example: A z Test for Proportions in Action</h2>
  <h3>Scenario (pg. 253): This is a \(z\) Test for Proportion</h3>

<p>In a small community, the <em>proportions</em> of minorities make up 20% of  the population. The School Board President believes that minorities as teachers are under-represented in a specific school system. The current number of teachers is 100. Finally, the current system has only 15 minority faculty. </p>

<p>Let:</p>

<ul>
<li>\(P_s\) = .15 (population of minorities in the sample)</li>
<li>\(P_p\) = .20 (the proportion of minorities in the population)</li>
<li>\(Q_p\) = the proportion of the remaining members in the population

<ul>
<li>\(Q_p = 1-P_p\) because of probabilities (they always add to 1 or 100%)</li>
<li>\(Q_p = 1-P_p\) or \(1 - .20 = 0.80\)</li>

<li>\(n\) = 100 (the size of the sample or group being studied)</li>
<li>\(\alpha = 0.05\) and \(z_{crit}=1.65\)</li>

<h3>Hypothesis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Based on the scenario...we can use a one-tailed... a directional hypothesis</li>

  <h2>Example: A z Test for Proportions in Action, continued</h2>
  <h3>Scenario (pg. 253): This is a \(z\) Test for Proportion</h3>

<li><p>\(z = \frac{P_s - P_p}{\sqrt{\frac{P_PQ_p}{n}}}\) = \(\frac{.15 - .20}{\sqrt{\frac{(.20) x (.80)}{100}}}\) </p></li>
<li><p>Solving we have
\(\frac{-.05}{\sqrt{\frac{.16}{100}}}\) = \(\frac{-.05}{\sqrt{.0016}}\) = \(\frac{-.05}{.04}=-1.25\)</p></li>
<li><p>Our calculated z score for proportions is: \(-1.25\)</p></li>

<h3>Decision</h3>

<ul>
<li>Hypothesis test results: \(1.25 < 1.65\)</li>
